xacro
=====

Standalone xacro parser based on code extracted from ROS.

Note - because [substitution args](http://ros.org/wiki/roslaunch/XML#substitution_args) require
an entire ROS installation to be present and the goal was to have a
non-ROS xacro parser, this project does not handle subsitution args.

This code was originally written by Stuart Glaser for the ROS project.
